## About : 
We were fascinated by the complexity and diversity of batik patterns, each with its own unique history, technique, and cultural context. At the same time, we recognized that this knowledge was often not easily accessible, especially to younger generations and those outside the traditional batik-making communities. Our app aims to make it easy for users to recognize the pattern of batik in Indonesia.
